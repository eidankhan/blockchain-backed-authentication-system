Blocked Chain Based Authentication System in Spring Boot

Key Features of the Project:
•	Decentralized Authentication: Utilize blockchain’s decentralized nature to create a trustless authentication system.
•	Smart Contracts: Implement smart contracts to manage user authentication and permissions.
•	User Behavior Analysis: Use machine learning (ML) to analyze user behavior during authentication attempts.
•	Transparency: Ensure transparency in authentication processes by recording transactions on the blockchain.

Cyber-security Problems Solved:
•	Identity Theft: Blockchain-based authentication prevents unauthorized access and identity theft.
•	Data Breaches: Enhances security by eliminating centralized points of failure.
•	Fraud Prevention: Smart contracts enforce authentication rules, reducing the risk of fraud.
